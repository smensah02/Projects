From ancient times, those who work on ships and at sea have fascinated the popular imagination, whether they be sailors, pirates, merchant mariners or [ship's cats](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr06/2013/8/8/16/enhanced-buzz-22213-1375994261-13.jpg?downsize=715:*&amp;output-format=auto&amp;output-quality=auto). 

Our subreddit is fortunate enough to have several contributors who study different aspects of maritime history, and so today we are hosting a Panel AMA on the history of Sailors &amp; Sailing. Most of our panelists cover the era from the Age of Discovery to the Modern Period, a time spanning roughly from the 15th Century to the 20th Century AD, and we are also including a panelist with special experience in the Roman era! 

We are eager to hear all your questions about pirates, navies, shipyards, and trading on the high seas. 

Without further ado, here are the panelists:

/u/an_ironic_username [20th C. Naval Warfare | Whaling](#flair-military) -- u/an_ironic_username has an interest in the history of whaling, he is here to discuss whaling practices and life from the traditional 19th Century to the industrialized practices of the early 20th. Additionally, he can discuss naval warfare in the 20th Century, with an emphasis on the War at Sea in World War One.

/u/b1uepenguin [Pacific World | France Overseas](#flair-oceania) - /u/b1uepenguin has a special interest in the Age of Exploration and 19th Century shipping in the Pacific.

/u/DBHT14 [19th-20th C. Naval History](#flair-military) - /u/DBHT14 is interested in naval and military history, with knowledge ranging from the age of cannon and sail to the World Wars. Their expertise is in the Continental and United States Navy, Quasi War, Barbary Wars, and War of 1812 in particular.

/u/Elphinstone1842 [Golden Age of Piracy](#flair-other) - u/Elphinstone1842 focuses on the history of European pirates, buccaneers and privateers in the Caribbean and elsewhere from the 17th to early 18th centuries. 

/u/jschooltiger [Moderator | Shipbuilding &amp; Logistics | British Navy 1770-1830](#flair-moderator) — I am particularly interested in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic period, but I have also done fairly extensive reading on the allied and Japanese navies in the Pacific theater of WWII. 

/u/mikedash [Top Quality Contributor](#flair-qualitycontributor)

/u/terminus-trantor [Portuguese Empire 1400-1580](#flair-europe) - I am most familiar with Portuguese (and to a lesser degree Spanish) ships and life on board their ships in the 15th and 16th century. I can also offer some insight into navigational science and tools of the Age of Exploration.

/u/thefourthmaninaboat [20th Century Royal Navy](#flair-military) - /u/thefourthmaninabot has a special interest in the history of the Royal Navy from 1900 to the modern day, and in the naval operations of WWI.

/u/Tiako [Roman Archaeology](#flair-archaeology) - On ships, merchants, and piracy in the Roman Empire.

Primarily, I'm interested in knowing how often, if ever, historians take into consideration what *future* historians would find useful when assessing the scope and significance of the loss of a museum such as this one. 

Do historians ever attempt to preserve certain historical or contemporary artifacts and documents for future generations with the knowledge that it is precisely *these* sorts of documents and artifacts that they themselves would like to possess when engaging in historical scholarship?

Or a bit more precisely, we have a fairly good idea of what was lost in this fire because individuals who worked there are able to tell us just what was contained in these collections. Does this first-hand knowledge ever become formally documented after an event like this so that future historians with no access to individuals who worked at the museum can nevertheless still have an idea of what this museum contained?

My second question is, given the prevalence of technology such as smartphones with built in cameras, it would be reasonable to think there exist massive amounts of personally taken photos of the contents in the museum so that, even if the original artifacts no longer exist, at the very least photos of them still do. Is this helpful to future historians?

The final duel that takes place in England, however, features a different procedure: instead of firing simultaneously at the count of three, the duelists take turns firing at each other, with their appointed seconds asking the person whose turn it was to receive fire to vocally confirm that they were ready before their rival would shoot.

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.

&lt;p&gt;I assume the complete records of the Luftwaffe were lost to time as of which I doubt it would be possible to know the who was the pilot, what was the aircraft and so on. But given the date what was the most likely bomb used? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for the lack of things to go on but my hometown has the tendency to be difficult when it comes to research that is obscure. &lt;/p&gt;

I was always enamoured, as much of the world is, by the tale of Hannibal crossing into Italy with his army to attack Rome with.

Several things always stand out in the story:

1) Hannibal’s army had significant losses during the crossing. This should mean that they are many corpses or at least equipment strewn along the route he took.

2) Histories make a point of saying that the exact route Hannibal took is not known.

I feel like this would be an interesting, if challenging archeological expedition for several reasons:

1) the mountain routes couldn’t have changed that much over time so there must be a finite number of routes to search.

2) yes snows and ice shift which complicates finding the routes but that also presents an opportunity. I attended a lecture of a palaeontologist who was surveying Canada’s arctic for prehistoric animal remains (camels and mammoths mostly) and she told me how during spring new remains would be revealed without them having to dig, they just had to explore the area and would find some bones that weren’t there the year before. Would this not apply to the remains of Hannibal’s army?

3) mountain climate is great for preserving things.

You can look at Everest as an example and the bodies that are still there, or even the remarkable condition that Mallory’s body and equipment was in when he was found.

Or if you want Alp specific, Ötzi the ice man was found preserved in the alps by some tourists as the shifting snow suddenly revealed him. Ötzi was from approx 3300BC which is even older than Hannibal’s feat.

So that is my case for why I think it would be possible to find the remains of some of Hannibal’s alp army.

To start off, as some of you noticed, we have been [test running 'Great Question!' flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/93p79c/introducing_great_question_flair_to_be_tested_for/) this past month. [These are designated by the mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3AGreat%2BQuestion!), and at the end of the month, we held a mod vote for the one that really struck us most of all from that batch. The inaugural winner, with the Best Question of August is /u/megami-hime who asked: [""The Scramble for Africa saw Ethiopia not only remaining uncolonized but also an expansion of territory. How did Ethiopian imperial policy compare to those of European colonizers?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9aqn4j/the_scramble_for_africa_saw_ethiopia_not_only/e4xh98h) And of course while the award is independent of the question being answered, recognition is well deserved for /u/khosikulu's response to the query.

For August, the ""Flair's Choice"" award goes to /u/yawarpoma, for their excellent response to [""It's the early 16th century. I'm a young, ambitious, European man looking to make a name for myself as part of the Spanish conquest of the New World. How do I go about joining an expedition and what would life be like once we get to the Americas?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/971pka/its_the_early_16th_century_im_a_young_ambitious/e46l94m/?context=3)

This month's ""User's Choice"" awardee is /u/JimeDorje, who answered [""Why was in China's interest to invade Tibet?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/91znnx/why_was_in_chinas_interest_to_invade_tibet/e3h1flf/?context=3).

Finally, we have quite an interesting case for the ""Dark Horse Award"" this month! Having both written fantastic, and quite complementary answers to [""Operation Dragoon, the Allied Invasion of southern France from the Mediterranean was 75 years ago today. How did the operation play out?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/97gwdw/operation_dragoon_the_allied_invasion_of_southern), /u/historymystery12345 and /u/thefourthmaninaboat were nominated in *tandem* on a single ballot, and in a hard fought close second overall, and a clear winner for top (half) non-flair answers, they are splitting the award 50-50, but are both 100 percent deserving.

Finally, the Excellence in Flairdom Award for August 2018 goes to none other than /u/restricteddata! You probably know them as the person who answers questions related to nuclear weapons...any question related to nuclear weapons...*all* questions related even tangentially to nuclear weapons. RD relishes diving into extended answers based on original research while not hesitating to take on small things for no glory. And when historiography or humanities questions come up, RD almost always leads the charge with clear, forceful arguments. Thanks, /u/restricteddata!

The winners each receive a month of reddit gold in recognition of their accomplishment!

So as always, a big congratulations to the winners, and a big thanks to everyone who contributed to the subreddit in the past month! Also a reminder, if you want to nominate answers for the monthly awards, the best way to do so is to submit your favorite posts every week to the [Sunday Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)!

&lt;p&gt;To start off, as some of you noticed, we have been &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/93p79c/introducing_great_question_flair_to_be_tested_for/""&gt;test running &amp;#39;Great Question!&amp;#39; flair&lt;/a&gt; this past month. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;q=flair%3AGreat%2BQuestion!""&gt;These are designated by the mods&lt;/a&gt;, and at the end of the month, we held a mod vote for the one that really struck us most of all from that batch. The inaugural winner, with the Best Question of August is &lt;a href=""/u/megami-hime""&gt;/u/megami-hime&lt;/a&gt; who asked: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9aqn4j/the_scramble_for_africa_saw_ethiopia_not_only/e4xh98h""&gt;&amp;quot;The Scramble for Africa saw Ethiopia not only remaining uncolonized but also an expansion of territory. How did Ethiopian imperial policy compare to those of European colonizers?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; And of course while the award is independent of the question being answered, recognition is well deserved for &lt;a href=""/u/khosikulu""&gt;/u/khosikulu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s response to the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For August, the &amp;quot;Flair&amp;#39;s Choice&amp;quot; award goes to &lt;a href=""/u/yawarpoma""&gt;/u/yawarpoma&lt;/a&gt;, for their excellent response to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/971pka/its_the_early_16th_century_im_a_young_ambitious/e46l94m/?context=3""&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the early 16th century. I&amp;#39;m a young, ambitious, European man looking to make a name for myself as part of the Spanish conquest of the New World. How do I go about joining an expedition and what would life be like once we get to the Americas?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;User&amp;#39;s Choice&amp;quot; awardee is &lt;a href=""/u/JimeDorje""&gt;/u/JimeDorje&lt;/a&gt;, who answered &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/91znnx/why_was_in_chinas_interest_to_invade_tibet/e3h1flf/?context=3""&gt;&amp;quot;Why was in China&amp;#39;s interest to invade Tibet?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have quite an interesting case for the &amp;quot;Dark Horse Award&amp;quot; this month! Having both written fantastic, and quite complementary answers to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/97gwdw/operation_dragoon_the_allied_invasion_of_southern""&gt;&amp;quot;Operation Dragoon, the Allied Invasion of southern France from the Mediterranean was 75 years ago today. How did the operation play out?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/historymystery12345""&gt;/u/historymystery12345&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/u/thefourthmaninaboat""&gt;/u/thefourthmaninaboat&lt;/a&gt; were nominated in &lt;em&gt;tandem&lt;/em&gt; on a single ballot, and in a hard fought close second overall, and a clear winner for top (half) non-flair answers, they are splitting the award 50-50, but are both 100 percent deserving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Excellence in Flairdom Award for August 2018 goes to none other than &lt;a href=""/u/restricteddata""&gt;/u/restricteddata&lt;/a&gt;! You probably know them as the person who answers questions related to nuclear weapons...any question related to nuclear weapons...&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; questions related even tangentially to nuclear weapons. RD relishes diving into extended answers based on original research while not hesitating to take on small things for no glory. And when historiography or humanities questions come up, RD almost always leads the charge with clear, forceful arguments. Thanks, &lt;a href=""/u/restricteddata""&gt;/u/restricteddata&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winners each receive a month of reddit gold in recognition of their accomplishment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as always, a big congratulations to the winners, and a big thanks to everyone who contributed to the subreddit in the past month! Also a reminder, if you want to nominate answers for the monthly awards, the best way to do so is to submit your favorite posts every week to the &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all""&gt;Sunday Digest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot: and then he espied that he had his armour and his horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of king Arthur: for on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them: and because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace.

But sometimes knights would fight under different arms in tournaments, either because they were asked to or for their own reasons:

&gt;This shield was given me \[Sir Tristram\], not desired, of queen Morgan le Fay. \[...\] Truly, said king Arthur, ye ought to bear none arms but if ye wist what ye bear. But I pray you tell me your name. To what intent? said Sir Tristram. For I would wit, said king Arthur. Sir, ye shall not wit as at this time. Then shall ye and I do battle together, said king Arthur.

​

&gt;Then at the request of queen Guenever and of king Bagdemagus, Sir Launcelot came into the range, but he was disguised, and that was the cause that few folk knew him.

And at least once, Lancelot disguises himself as a woman in order to get the drop on another knight (though in context this might just be comic relief):

&gt;And as he was departed, Sir Launcelot disguised himself, and put upon his armour a maiden’s garment freshly attired. Then Sir Launcelot made Sir Galihodin to lead him through the range, and all men had wonder what damsel it was. And so as Sir Dinadan came into the range, Sir Launcelot, that was in the damsel’s array, gat Galihodin’s spear, and ran unto Sir Dinadan.

My question, then, is why this happens so often. Did historical knights disguise themselves for any reason, or was this theme invented by Romantic authors? If it is made up, why does Lancelot, paragon of chivalry, seem to disguise himself so often? It doesn't seem consistent with chivalry as I understand it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been reading an abridged version of Thomas Mallory&amp;#39;s Morte d&amp;#39;Arthur and this situation comes up numerous times, especially with Sir Lancelot.

Many nations secularized throughout history, but usually it was followed by a period of more gradual societal changes, such as modernization, industrialization, urbanization, scientific rationalism, and enlightenment. The closest I can think was the anticlericalism which followed the French revolution, but (for its time) France was an intellectually leading nation for a long time and a chief leader of the Enlightenment. Even then, the anticlerical movement was never accepted by French society as a whole - it was constant fuel for countryside rebellions - and eventually ended almost as quick as it started, after the Thermidorian Reaction and the Concordat of Napoleon, which resulted in a reconciliation, and many church privileges were restored. 

Whereas for Soviet Russia, many changes which contribute to secularism only came *after* the Bolsheviks came to power (e.g. industrialization and compulsory education). Imperial Russia had a modernization initiative by Peter I, and an ""elite Enlightenment"" period by Catherine II, but in terms of social changes, both mostly touched the elites and urban dwellers - the serfs (who were by far most of Russian's population) remained largely outside the movement, and even after their emancipation in 1861, very little was done to better their lot (which, in turn, was one of the lead catalysts of the 1917 Revolutions).

The question therefore, is not why the Revolutions happened, or even why the Bolsheviks won in general, but how they were able to win despite such as open and radical atheist platform - and *keep* it for the entire duration of the Soviet State (with small breaks and exceptions here and there, such as a temporary relief during the Great Patriotic War). 

Sure, Russian society was very polarized by social class inequality, and many poor would see the clergy leadership as ""one of them"", hostile to the masses, but ordinary priests were little better off than their fellow countrymen, and just as distant from the Orthodox Church elites as the average peasant was from the Russian nobility. 

A platform against individual senior clergymen, or individual church policies, would be a lot more palpable for the masses (not unlike the likes of Luther who rallied against perceived corruption in the Catholic Church).

I've never had history lessons about Aztec civilization, so everything I wrote is based on quick internet research. I'll try to be as brief as possible:

The story is told through the eyes of a father of a small family of 4. It's about the downfall of aztec civilization encompassing the plague and the Conquistadores' invasion. The narrative has a ""mythological component"" as you'll see later.

It's set in late 1520, on small farming village, Ahuacatlan, who relies on trading with a couple different tribes/villages (all aztecs). One day hawkers start bringing strange tales about pale giants (conquistadores). ""They come from the sea and wield powerful weapons that bark fire and spit death from a distance. They've got indestructible shining armor from the color of the sun"" - hawkers say.

These hawkers start getting sick, they wake up with belly pains, black tongue, and their noses dont stop bleeding. A strange pestilence starts spreading across tribes while farmers get sick and food gets scarce. Priests claim these are punishments from their angry gods: they demand more blood rituals! Human sacrifices are performed, but nothing seems to stop what looks like to be the end of the world. 

The tribe ""closes off their village"" and fortify the area (placing traps, etc...) in fear of nearby tribes' attacks. Soon these giants, who everyone thinks are sent by raging gods, invade this small and weak village: they easily start killing everyone while the family escapes. The family runs away and passes by what were once friendly, but now turned enemy tribes. Some villages are burning, others are completely empty. They pass by famished people dying in the streets, wounded soldiers and misery spread through the  roads they take. The family is encounters these new invading giants and they are forced to hide from them, when the parents start showing signs of sickness. They decide to abandon their kids to luck, so they have a chance to live and start a new life far away from there.

Any thoughts? What's accurate/innacurate here? The story is far from finished so I have a lot of room to change/rewrite stuff to accommodate for accuracy.

The points made by Bernard sounds reasonable enough for a laymen like me, though at the same time i found them a little odd.  Given the nature of nuclear weapons I was rather surprised that the weapon systems were contracted out to the competitive market like other conventional arms (this is the impression I was given at least, do correct me if I’m wrong).

But worse than that were the really poor folk who couldn't even afford to buy a pot......they ""didn't have a pot to piss in"" &amp; were the lowest of the low.  The next time you are washing your hands and complain because the water temperature isn't just how you like it, think about how things used to be. 

Here are some facts about the 1500s:

Most people got married in June because they took their yearly bath in May, and they still smelled pretty good by June.. However, since they were starting to smell . ...... . Brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor. Hence the custom today of carrying a bouquet when getting Married.

Baths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water. The man of the house had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other sons and men, then the women and finally the children. Last of all the babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it.. Hence the saying, ""Don't throw the baby out with the Bath water!""

Houses had thatched roofs-thick straw-piled high, with no wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all the cats and other small animals (mice, bugs) lived in the roof. When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would slip and fall off the roof... Hence the saying ""It's raining cats and dogs.""

There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. This posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings could mess up your nice clean bed. Hence, a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded some protection. That's how canopy beds came into existence.

The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt. Hence the saying, ""Dirt poor."" The wealthy had slate floors that would get slippery in the winter when wet, so they spread thresh (straw) on floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they added more thresh until, when you opened the door, it would all start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the entrance-way. Hence: a thresh hold.

In those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that always hung over the fire.. Every day they lit the fire and added things to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. Sometimes stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while. Hence the rhyme: Peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine days old. Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man could, ""bring home the bacon."" They would cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and chew the fat.

Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with high acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, causing lead poisoning death. This happened most often with tomatoes, so for the next 400 years or so, tomatoes were considered poisonous.

Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom of the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests got the top, or the upper crust.

Lead cups were used to drink ale or whisky. The combination would Sometimes knock the imbibers out for a couple of days. Someone walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for burial.. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and see if they would wake up. Hence the custom of holding a wake.

England is old and small and the local folks started running out of places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a bone-house, and reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, 1 out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized they had been burying people alive... So they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night (the graveyard shift.) to listen for the bell; thus, someone could be, saved by the bell or was considered a dead ringer.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used to use urine to tan animal skins, so families used to all pee in a pot &amp;amp; then once a day it was taken &amp;amp; Sold to the tannery.......if you had to do this to survive you were &amp;quot;Piss Poor&amp;quot;

**Historians in the Classroom**

Historians are both ahead of and behind the pedagogical times.  A standard introductory level history course is taught by the “sage on the stage,” performing an extended verbal essay each 50-minute class period.  The pedagogical literature has for many years encouraged us to instead act as a “guide by the side,” a model prevalent in upper-level discussion-based or seminar courses.

*Active learning* is one of the core best-practices in pedagogy. At its essence, active learning is based on the principle that students learn by constructing their own understanding of material by building on their prior knowledge. Active learning includes an enormous range of strategies, including class discussions, debates, games, and brainstorming. Activities that work relatively easily in larger classes include Think-Pair-Share, note comparison, clickers, video reflections, and one-minute reflections.

As detail oriented as we historians are, it can be difficult for us to move away from a *coverage model* of teaching. However, if we give up the sage on the stage method of teaching in favor of discussions, activities, and/or projects, it means giving up the control and pace that allows for a coverage model of teaching. The pedagogical literature supports slowing down to cover less material more deeply. More pedagogically-oriented lectures, including elements such as active learning, handouts, and assessment of student learning, is better received by students. (See, for example, Saroyan and Snell, 1997.)

**Tech in the Classroom**

Although we here on AskHistorians are clearly not allergic to the twenty-first century, many of our colleagues are reluctant to incorporate technology in the classroom. What are the pros and cons of tech in the classroom?

Needless to say, technology is frequently distracting.  But aside from the temptations of reddit, students taking notes on laptops perform worse on higher-level or conceptual questions. Research by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) suggests that laptops allow students to take verbatim notes, which leads to less processing during lecture material.

On the other hand, we must allow technology in the classroom if for no other reason than to provide accommodations to students with disabilities. Many advocates of technology in the classroom insist that the nature of class time and assessments must be changed to make effective use of the wide array of tools and information available to students today. Laptops will not be distracting if students are actively engaging in research, synthesis, or presentation. *Digital humanities* has become a sexy methodology in the discipline, and some advanced-degree-granting institutions have even begun to offer classes or certificates in digital teaching and/or research methodologies. However, the implementation of DH in the classroom varies widely.

The bottom line is that you should have a tech policy and explain your rationale to your students. This *transparency* will help students buy into your policy and demonstrate the thought you put into your teaching.

**Who we Teach**

History departments have faced [declining enrollments](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2018/enrollment-declines-continue-aha-survey-again-shows-fewer-undergraduates-in-history-courses) in the last few years. (Although surprisingly, [this trend did not directly coincide with the 2007-8 economic crisis](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2012/clios-charm-holding-fast).) [The recent high in the number of history BAs conferred was in 2012](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2017/decline-in-history-majors-continues-departments-respond).

In the US, our students reflect our changing national demographics. The number of history BA degrees awarded to women and traditionally underrepresented minority groups [have been rising](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2017/decline-in-history-majors-continues-departments-respond). Although women are overrepresented in humanities disciplines, they made up just 40.3% of history BAs awarded in 2015. Many universities are improving their support-systems for first-generation or otherwise at-risk students by implementing new programming, such as advising, first-year college-skills courses, or mentoring.

**What we Teach**

Concurrent with the growth of a diverse student population, many departments and faculty have pressed for a more diverse curriculum. While academic hiring for history faculty has shrunk significantly since the academic crash of 2007-08, the steepest long-term declines have been in European history. The number of positions in world, Latin American, African, Asian, and Middle Eastern history has [risen over the long-term](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2011/decline-of-the-west-or-the-rise-of-the-rest) (though [hiring in those fields is still inconsistent in the current market](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/november-2017/another-tough-year-for-the-academic-job-market-in-history)). The readjustment of faculty specializations has accompanied efforts to decolonialize the curriculum. Departments have been replacing “Western Civilization” with courses in global history. Increasing calls are also being made to diversify the US history survey course chronologically, geographically, and culturally. Here’s a “fun” game for anyone teaching or learning the US history survey: What is the start date of your course? What political values stand behind that starting point? How does the narrative of the course change with other start dates?

Another aspect of teaching that’s at the crossroads of economic pressure, technology, and our increasingly diverse student bodies is the textbook itself. The rising cost of textbooks has been an issue of outrage for several years. A movement for Open Educational Resources has advocated for freely accessibly and openly licensed media for learning purposes. Some excellent resources are being developed for history, including [The American Yawp](http://www.americanyawp.com), a textbook written by college-level instructors, which in my estimation far surpasses standard textbooks on the market with its range of up-to-date scholarship. Personally, I find myself teaching outside my primary fields this year, and I have been most struck by the lack of resources for educators teaching outside the traditional major survey-courses. Historians, do you have recommendations for teaching resources in your field?

**Recommended Reading**

A few books in the scholarship of teaching and learning that I recommend for historians are:

James M. Lang, Small Teaching: Everyday Lessons from the Science of Learning Jossey-Bass 2016

Lang’s book has quickly become a classic in this field. It contains ideas and strategies for working active learning into your teaching without majorly overhauling your classes. The style, lack of jargon, and practical content also make it a good starting place if you’re unfamiliar with the pedagogy literature.

Therese Huston, Teaching What You Don’t Know (multiple eds.)

This one’s for the many grad students here in AskHistorians. What do you do when you, a medievalist, is asked to teach US women’s history? What if you get that prized TT position after having promised in your job letter that of course you could teach the survey course that begins several centuries before your period of expertise? This book is for you! Huston provides practical strategies for getting through a course outside your field. I particularly appreciate the care she takes to consider the intersections of age, race, and background in establishing authority in the classroom.

Barbara E. Walvoord, *Effective Grading:* *A Tool for Learning and Assessment in College* (multiple eds.)

Grading is frequently one of our least favorite tasks as instructors. How can we save our own time, improve our student ratings, and preempt complaints about fairness? Walvoord’s book describes best practices for a variety of kinds of assignments. One of her specialties is in teaching writing, which makes this book a great choice for history instructors.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should preface our conversation about pedagogy by divulging that I am an academic in the US teaching in-person classes at the university level.

EDIT 2: I know that I shouldn't be trying to stifle intelligent conversation, but could I please just ask people whose only response is to defend TCM to just stop, please?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href=""https://nccih.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/introduction.htm#hed3""&gt;74% of Americans have used chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17480138""&gt;a 2002 survey showed 8.8% of Hongkongers had consulted a TCM practitioner in the past 6 months&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1475491617300231""&gt;in a 2005 survey, 3.1% of British people had received some kind of homeopathic treatment in the past 12 months&lt;/a&gt;. My general impression – and I understand that this is heavily anecdotal – is that not many people are even aware that some of the less extreme cases (particularly chiropractic and TCM) are pseudosciences. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
